            <p>Dear,</p>
            <p>From the moment we met, my life has been brighter and more beautiful. Your smile, your laughter, and your
                presence make every day special.</p>
            <p>Today, I am here to ask for a simple I love you</p>
			<p>It really means a lot for me, yes just a simple "I Love You"</p>
            <p>I cherish the moments we've shared, and I look forward to creating many more beautiful memories together.
                Your answer means the world to me.</p>
            <p>With love,</p>
            <p>Your Neel</p>
